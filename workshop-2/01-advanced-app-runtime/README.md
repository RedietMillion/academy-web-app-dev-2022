## Tasks intructions 

There are three simple tasks to be completed in the `exercises` folder. 

The comments that are important are the ones containing `@TODO`. 

The tasks can be performed directly through the CodeSandox link: [ADD LINK]

### TASK 1 - Using Dynamic queries and variables 

In this task you will convert a static query into a dynamic one. You will be working in the `ProgramsList.js` component (check first comments `@TODO-1`)

### TASK 2 - Define a dynamic delete mutation  

Here you will be working mostly in the `DeleteProgram.js` component. Check for comments starting with `@TODO-2`. The goal of this task is to make the Delete button work. 

You will implement a delete mutation using dynamic query techniques. 

### TASK 3 - Using `Alerts` 

Check the comments in the `ProgramList.js` component starting with `@TODO-3`. 

In this task you will use a simple `useAlert` to show alerts when a program has been created
