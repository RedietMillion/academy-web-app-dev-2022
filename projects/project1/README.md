# Project 1: Build a modern DHIS2 app

Project 1 is _not_ a mandatory project assignment for
students who want to receive a certification. Feedback will still be provided by the core team and facilitators.  

This project will focus on what you've learned during Workshop 1 and you'll take that knowledge to build a DHIS2 application from scratch. ðŸŽŠ

## Description

In this project you are going to be building a simple DHIS2 application. You will initialize your app with the DHIS2 Application Platform and use the `@dhis2/ui` components following the DHIS2 design system. 

You will also have the chance to apply what your learned about the DHIS2 Application Runtime (by defining queries and retrieving data using the DHIS2 API). **Optional:** You may use data mutations as well to send data to a DHIS2 instance. 

You are free to choose the purpose of your application in this project. We only require that the requirements below be followed.

## Requirements

- **Must** be [initiatialized with the DHIS2 Application
  Platform](https://platform.dhis2.nu/#/scripts/init)
- **Must** use a layout with sidebar navigation
- [`@dhis2/ui`](https://ui.dhis2.nu/#/getting-started) components **must**
  be used to build custom forms, tables and components wherever applicable 
- [DHIS2 design guidelines](https://github.com/dhis2/design-system)
  **must** be followed when using `@dhis2/ui` components and an
  attempt _should_ be made to follow the guidelines for custom
  components,
  [layout](https://github.com/dhis2/design-system/blob/master/principles/spacing-alignment.md),
  [colors](https://github.com/dhis2/design-system/blob/master/principles/color.md)
  and
  [typography](https://github.com/dhis2/design-system/blob/master/principles/typography.md)
- App **must** contain at least one component that uses a [data
  query](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/useDataQuery). _Optional_: at least
  one component that uses a
  [mutation](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/useDataMutation) from
  the [DHIS2 Application
  Runtime](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/getting-started)
