# Project 1: Build a modern DHIS2 app

Project 1 is _not_ a mandatory project assignment for
students who want to receive a certification. Feedback will still be provided by the core team and  facilitators.  

This project will focus on what you've learned during Workshop 1 and you'll take that knowledge to build a DHIS2 application from scratch. ðŸŽŠ
